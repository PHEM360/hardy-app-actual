## Firebase cleanup script

This repository includes a conservative cleanup script template at `scripts/clean-firebase.ts` which can delete non-production test data from a Firebase project.

Important notes:
- The script is destructive. Do NOT run it without a full backup and verifying the whitelist constants inside the script.
- You must provide service account credentials and set the environment variables before running.

Quick usage:

```bash
# set path to your service account JSON key
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/key.json"
export FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="hardyhub-7b30d"
# safety flag: must be set to run deletions
export REALLY_I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_IS_PERMANENT=1

npx ts-node scripts/clean-firebase.ts
```

Edit the `WHITELISTED_USER_EMAILS` and `WHITELISTED_COLLECTIONS` arrays inside the script before running.
